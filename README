$('#slides').preso({
  pagerClass: 'nav-pager', //Class to put on the unordered list that contains links to each slide
  prevNextClass: 'nav-prev-next', //Class to put on the unordered list that contains the previous and next links
  prevText: 'Previous', //Text for the Previous link
  nextText: 'Next', //Text for the Next link
  transition: 'fade' //Possible values are 'fade', 'show/hide', 'slide'
});
